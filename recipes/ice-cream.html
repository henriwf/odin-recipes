    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream 
        that has been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an 
        alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit,
         such as strawberries or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes 
         added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below 
         the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces
          and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming.</p>
