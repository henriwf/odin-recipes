    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Risotto is an Italian rice dish cooked with broth until it reaches a creamy 
        consistency. The broth can be derived from meat, fish, or vegetables. Many 
        types of risotto contain butter, onion, white wine, and Parmesan cheese.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Chicken or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>Olive oil and butter</li>
        <li>Onion and garlic</li>
        <li>Arborio rice</li>
        <li>White wine</li>
        <li>Parmesan</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>Sea salt</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the stock in a pot on the stove, bringing it to a gentle simmer.</li>
        <li>Melt the olive oil and butter in a large pan or dutch oven. Cook the onion until it starts to brown, then add the garlic.</li>
        <li>Add the rice, stir, then add the wine. Continue stirring until the wine absorbs.</li>
        <li>Add a ladle of broth, and continue stirring until it absorbs. Repeat this process until most of the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is soft but al dente.</li>
        <li>When the rice is done, turn off the heat and stir in the parmesan cheese, fresh thyme, and ground pepper.</li>
    </ol>
